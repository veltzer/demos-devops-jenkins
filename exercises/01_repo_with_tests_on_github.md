* if you don't have a github account - open one
* open a repo to play with (call it "test"?) and make it public so that you will not
  have to provide credentials or keys for Jenkins to access it.
* add some python code to your repo, for example,
	add a python function called add(a,b) in a file called add.py that returns a+b
* add a test to your code using pytest or unittest (look it up).
	* check that `add(2,2)==4`
* push you code to you github repo.
* Configure a pipeline job in jenkins and connect it to your github repository.
	Tell the pipeline to use the "Jenkinsfile" in your source repository.
* Tell jenkins how to run you tests by placing the appropriate "Jenkinsfile"
	at the root of your repository and telling it how to run your python tests.
* Run a jenkins job and see how jenkins pulls your code from github and tests it.
	(This is done from the Jenkins GUI).
* You may need to install 'pytest' on your machine so that jenkins could use it.

Hints:
* here is a python function that adds two integers and returns their sum:
    `add.py`
    ```python
    def add(a, b):
        return a+b
    ```
* here is a test for that function:
    `tests/test_add.py`
    ``` python
    from add import add
    def test_add():
        assert add(2,2)==4
    ```
* to install pytest use:
    `$ pip install pytest`
