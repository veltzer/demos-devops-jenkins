The idea behind this exercise is to run pipelines in parallel.

- Create a jenkins pipeline which does two stages
	(sleep?) in sequence.
	Show that it works. (by activating the build manually).

- Modify your pipeline to do two things in parallel
	(sleep?). Find out on your own how to do it.
	Show that it works. (by activating the build manually).

Notes:
* Remember that the number of your executors is 2 so have more than 2 pipeline allowed
	to run in parallel.
* Have a few stages in each of the pipelines (to simulate a real work complex project)
* Install (or check that it's already installed) the ocean-ui plugin to visualize the
	parallel execution (Not a must, nice to have)
* For the time, still use the "any" executor.
