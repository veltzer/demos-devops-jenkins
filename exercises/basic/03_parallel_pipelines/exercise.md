# Parallel Pipelines

The idea behind this exercise is to run pipelines in parallel.

* Create a jenkins pipeline which does two stages
    (sleep?) in sequence.
    Show that it works. (by activating the build manually).
    Write the sleep either in Groovy or in shell.

* Modify your pipeline to do two things in parallel
    (sleep?). Find out on your own how to do it.
    Show that it works. (by activating the build manually).

* Install (or check that it's already installed) the `ocean-ui` plugin to visualize the
    parallel execution (Not a must, nice to have)

Notes:
* Remember to have at least 2 executors so that stuff will actually run in parallel.
* Have a few stages in each of the pipelines (to simulate a real work complex project)
* For the time, still use the "any" executor.
